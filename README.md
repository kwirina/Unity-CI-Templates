# 🚀 Unity CI/CD Pipeline
📌 **Note:** This project was renamed from *Unity-CI-Templates* to *Unity-CI-CD*. Since I originally created it, the project has grown quite a bit beyond just a few CI-templates...
The new name *'Unity-CI-CD'* reflects better what it is now, and leaves room for where it’s headed next, and not just what it started as.

**Seamless testing, multi-platform builds, releases & deploys for Unity.**

## 🌐 WebGL Demo

See a live WebGL build deployed using this CI/CD pipeline:

> Deployed via GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` deploy target.


## 🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Ensure your Unity project is in a GitHub repository  
2️⃣ Copy the required GitHub Actions workflows from the [CICD_Workflows folder](https://github.com/Avalin/Unity-CI-CD/tree/main/CICD_Workflows)  
3️⃣ Add them to your repository at path: **.github → workflows** _(create folders if missing)_<br/>
4️⃣ Configure the [required secrets](https://github.com/Avalin/Unity-CI-CD/wiki/Required-Secrets) in your repository<br/>
5️⃣ Read and optionally setup [repository variables](https://github.com/Avalin/Unity-CI-CD/wiki/Repository-Variables), they're important to understand the inputs for the workflow dispatch<br/>
6️⃣ Try dispatching the `ci-cd-dispatcher.yml` workflow or push a Git tag using [SemVer](https://github.com/Avalin/Unity-CI-CD/wiki/Versioning-&-Tagging) to see the pipeline in action! <br/>

> ⚠️ Currently tested deploy targets: `gh-pages` (WebGL only), `itch.io`. Others are implemented but not yet fully verified. Contributions welcome!

## ⚠ Current Limitations

While the pipeline is production-ready and modular, some deploy integrations are still marked as **experimental**:

- 🚧 **Deploy targets like Steam, TestFlight, App Center**  
  These are implemented but have not yet been fully validated in live release pipelines.

- 🔗 **External platforms may require manual setup**  
  Some targets (like itch.io, Firebase, S3) require correctly configured secrets and accounts - be sure to test deploy flows in a safe sandbox environment before pushing to production.

- 🧪 **Unity version compatibility**  
  Currently optimized for Unity 2022.3+, tested with Unity 6 too, but older versions may work as well.

> **Contributions and testing feedback are welcome!**  
> If you successfully validate additional targets or add new ones, please consider opening a PR to improve support for the community.
